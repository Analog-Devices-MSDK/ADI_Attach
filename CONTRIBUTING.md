# ADI Attach Development and Contribution Guidelines

# Development Flow

Development for the MSDK also follows the official [GitHub development flow guidelines](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/github-flow).


## Contribution Guidelines

The MSDK follows the [GitHub contribution guidelines](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/contributing-to-projects).  

External contributions from outside the [Analog Devices organization](https://github.com/Analog-Devices-MSDK) should be made via a Pull Request opened from a fork.  Internal contributions should also preferrably use a fork where possible.

If a direct branch on the mainline ADI Attach repo is made, the following branch naming conventions should be used when possible:

- Bugfix/ticket: `fix/ticketnumber`
- New feature: `feature/branchname`
- Generic development branch: `dev/branchname`
- New and/or modified example branch: `example/branchname`
